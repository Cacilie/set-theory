# Set Theory

This library attempts to create a set of utils to apply set theory on JS/TS. (pun intended).

---

Currently, Vanilla JS includes the Set Object  with some methods to do operations. But this methods stop workking properly when the rank of a set is greater than 1.

e.g.
With a set such that S = { 1 , {2}}

The objective ot this library is to provide functions that not just work with the usual sets but also with those sets described above.
